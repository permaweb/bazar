# Activity Filtering Improvements for Bazar

This document describes the improvements implemented to better filter and display user activities in the Bazar platform.

## Problem

Previously, the Activity Table in user profiles had several issues:

1. **Inability to distinguish direct transfers** - Direct transfers between users were mixed with marketplace activities
2. **Incorrect event labeling** - Too many transactions appeared as "Purchase"
3. **Missing price information** - Price data wasn't displayed correctly for some transactions
4. **No support for different transaction types** - The UI only supported a limited set of transaction types

## Solution Implemented

We've enhanced the activity tracking system with the following improvements:

### 1. Enhanced GraphQL Queries

- Added a dedicated query for direct transfers (`GET_DIRECT_TRANSFERS`)
- Improved filtering logic to properly identify marketplace vs. direct transfer transactions
- Added appropriate tag filtering to categorize different transaction types

### 2. Updated Data Structure

- Updated the `ProcessedOrder` interface to support additional transaction types
- Added a new `directTransfers` property to the `UserActivity` interface
- Added an `isDirectTransfer` flag to easily identify direct transfers

```typescript
interface UserActivity {
	listedOrders: ProcessedOrder[];
	cancelledOrders: ProcessedOrder[];
	executedOrders: ProcessedOrder[];
	directTransfers: ProcessedOrder[]; // Added for direct transfers
}

interface ProcessedOrder {
	// Existing fields
	type: 'LISTED' | 'CANCELLED' | 'PURCHASED' | 'SOLD' | 'TRANSFER-IN' | 'TRANSFER-OUT';
	// ...
	isDirectTransfer?: boolean; // Flag to identify direct transfers
}
```

### 3. ActivityTable Component Updates

- Updated the component to handle the new `directTransfers` property
- Added support for displaying "Transfer" events in the UI
- Enhanced the mapping logic to properly label different transaction types
- Fixed price display for all transaction types

### 4. Improved Transaction Processing

- Added better logic for distinguishing marketplace transactions vs. direct transfers
- Updated the `processExecutedOrders` function to better identify Purchases vs. Sales
- Added proper processing for direct transfers with `processDirectTransfers`

## Testing

A test script (`test-activity-filter.js`) has been created to verify these improvements:

```
node bazar/test-activity-filter.js
```

This script tests:

1. Proper identification of direct transfers
2. Correct categorization of marketplace activities
3. Accurate filtering of different transaction types

Additionally, a browser test page (`activity-test.html`) is available for manual testing of the GraphQL queries directly from the browser.

## Impact

These improvements ensure that:

1. Users can now see direct transfers of assets as a separate activity type
2. Marketplace activities are properly categorized as Listing, Purchase, Sale, or Unlisted
3. Price information is correctly displayed for all transaction types
4. The UI properly renders all transaction types with appropriate icons and labels

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:

1. Add more filtering options to let users focus on specific activity types
2. Implement better error handling for failed GraphQL queries
3. Add caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data
4. Enhance the visual display of different transaction types
