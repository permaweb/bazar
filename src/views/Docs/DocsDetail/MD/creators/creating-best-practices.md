## Creating best practices

Creating atomic assets may seem daunting at first, but once you understand a few basic tools and concepts, you'll be well on your way to becoming a permaweb pro. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when creating on the permaweb.

#### 1. Set up your permaweb profile

Just like on web2 social media, you wouldn’t want to share content from an incomplete profile. The same applies to the permaweb. When you create your permaweb profile, you can set your name, @username, bio, profile picture, and banner image.

#### 2. Decide if you are creating a collection or single uploads

Are you uploading a collection of atomic assets or a single atomic asset? This decision will determine how your assets are displayed and discovered.

###### Collection page

Collections allow you to create your own custom branding with a header image, thumbnail image, and description. Recommended size for collection images:

- **Header:** 16:9 aspect ratio, 1920 x 1080 pixels.
- **Thumbnail:** 1:1 aspect ratio, 300 x 300 pixels.

###### Collection assets

When uploading content to your collection, ensure you name the assets, provide a description, and include tags that represent the style and theme you are sharing.

When uploading, your assets will be displayed in the collection from newest to oldest. So, the first asset that you upload to Helix will display first in the collection.

###### Single atomic assets

You can also upload as many single atomic assets as you’d like. These atomic assets are standalone and not part of a collection. The upload process is the same for single atomic assets, just without the collection page details.

#### 3. 1-1 vs fractionalized

Atomic assets can be 1-1 or fractionalized, meaning users can purchase portions of an asset. The creator can determine the number of fractional shares for an atomic asset before uploading.

#### 4. Double check all information

Before uploading, it is important that the order, name, description, fractionalization info, and all other information are accurate and free of errors. Once uploaded to the permaweb, this information cannot be changed.

#### 5. Upload and share with the permaweb community

After uploading your atomic asset, it’s time to share it with the permaweb community. Tag [@OurBazAR](https://x.com/OurBazAR) in posts on X with your newly created atomic asset!

You can also check out other permaweb social platforms to share your work, such as [Typr](https://www.typr.day/#/).
