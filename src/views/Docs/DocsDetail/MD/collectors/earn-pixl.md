## How to earn PIXL

PIXL is a rewards token for purchasing atomic assets on the Universal Content Marketplace. When users buy atomic assets via Bazar or any UCM platform, they become eligible to receive PIXL tokens. Bazar tracks buying streaks, which occur when users buy one or more atomic assets on consecutive days. After your first purchase, your streak begins. You need to wait 24 hours until you can extend your streak by making another purchase. After this waiting period, you have 24 hours to make another purchase, or your streak will be lost. The longer the streak, the more $PIXL you earn. User's reward share weight starts at one, and each additional day of the streak the $PIXL reward share increases by 0.1, with a maximum weight of 4 for a 30 day streak. Streaks reset back to 1 every 30 days. You can see your streak, clock, $PIXL holdings, and daily $PIXL rewards by clicking the flame icon in the top right of the page.

#### PIXL Tokenomics

###### Yearly Reward Distribution:

###### Reward Distribution Mechanism

- Daily PIXL Rewards are minted and distributed based on purchase streak weights. For example, in a 24-hour period with 36,000 $PIXL minted, if Alice’s streak weight is 1 and Joe’s is 3, Alice receives 25% of the mint, while Joe receives 75%.

- Streak Weights: Each user’s reward share weight starts at 1. Every additional day of maintaining a streak increases the $PIXL reward share by 0.1, with a maximum weight of 4 for a 30-day streak. After 30 days, the streak resets back to 1.

###### UCM & Streaks

- The Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) tracks buying streaks, which occur when users purchase one or more Atomic Assets on consecutive days.

- Streak Benefits: A streak increases a user’s share of daily rewards. The longer your streak, the more $PIXL you can earn.

###### Fee Collection and Burn Mechanism

- UCM Fee: A 0.5% fee is collected for using the contract. **Bazar takes no fee.**

- If $wAR token is involved: The contract uses the fee to purchase $PIXL from available orders. If no “Sell” orders exist, the contract initiates a “Buy” order via a reverse Dutch auction.

- Burning $PIXL: The $PIXL acquired through this process is burned, reducing the total supply. Higher trading volumes and marketplace fees lead to more tokens being bought and burned.

###### Disclaimer: PIXL is a fun reward designed to incentivize discovery and interaction with atomic assets, and does not necessarily have financial value.
