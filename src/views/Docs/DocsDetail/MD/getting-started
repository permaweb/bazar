# Getting started on the permaweb

If you are new to the permaweb, here is your guide to create and verify a permaweb profile. Your permaweb profile is interoperable on all permaweb applications. 

## Create an Arweave Wallet

To begin your journey on the permaweb, start by creating a secure, non-custodial wallet. You can create an ArConnect wallet [here](https://www.arconnect.io/). 

## Get vouched (verification)

To ensure a quality permaweb experience, we employ a decentralized verification process. VouchDAO allows individuals to “vouch” for an Arweave address, verifying its identity and humanity. Being vouched grants access to additional permaweb features like receiving $PIXL and $STAMP tokens.

Get “vouched” through X [here](https://vouch-twitter.arweave.dev/#/).

Check if your wallet is vouched [here](https://vouch-dao.arweave.dev/).

## Customize a permaweb profile with ArProfile

Your Arweave wallet serves as your identity on the permaweb. Customize your permaweb profile with a @handle, name, bio and social links through [ArProfile](https://arprofile.arweave.dev/). Your profile information will carry over to all permaweb apps that support ArProfile.
