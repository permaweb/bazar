# What is a profit sharing token (PST)?

A profit sharing token (PST) is an atomic asset built using a [smartWeave ](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/smartweave) contract that allows fractionalized ownership. Profit sharing tokens allow users and creators to trade proportions of future profit from assets by trading the profit sharing token itself.

As you can see, assets listed on BazAR allow fractional ownership. BazAR is the first fully onchain digital content marketplace that allows for the partial ownership of content. This lowers the barrier of entry into the permaweb for users, and ensures creators are still compensated for their work.
