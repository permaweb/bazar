# What is $PIXL?

Pixel token ($PIXL) is a rewards token for purchasing atomic assets on the Universal Content Marketplace. When vouched users buy atomic assets via BazAR or any UCM, they become eligible to receive $PIXL tokens. BazAR tracks buying streaks which occur when users buy one or more atomic assets on consecutive days. The longer the streak, the more $PIXL they earn.

See $PIXL ownership, and swap $PIXL for $U [here](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/asset/tfalT8Z-88riNtoXdF5ldaBtmsfcSmbMqWLh2DHJIbg).

User's reward share weight starts at one, and each additional day of the streak the $PIXL reward share increases by 0.1, with a maximum weight of 4 for a 30 day streak. Streaks reset back to 1 every 30 days.

**Disclaimer: $PIXL is a fun reward designed to incentivize discovery and interaction with atomic assets, and does not necessarily have financial value.**
