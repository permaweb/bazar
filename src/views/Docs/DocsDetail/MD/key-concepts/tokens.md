## Tokens

The Arweave ecosystem has many different tokens with various utilities. This guide will simplify the most important tokens used on Bazar.

#### AR Token

The AR token is the native currency of Arweave. AR is needed to engage with the Arweave network, whether for data storage or token transfers. Users pay a one-time fee for permanent data storage. Learn more about how Arweave data storage works [here](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/storage-endowment). More info on how to get AR tokens [here](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/collectors/how-to-fund).

#### Wrapped AR (wAR)

Wrapped AR is an Arweave token wrapped and cross-chained onto AO. wAR is the token used to make transactions on Bazar. More info on how to get wAR tokens [here](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/collectors/how-to-fund).

#### PIXL

PIXL is a rewards token for purchasing atomic assets on the Universal Content Marketplace. The longer the buying streak, the higher the daily PIXL rewards. PIXL is a fun reward designed to incentivize discovery and interaction with atomic assets, and does not necessarily have financial value.
