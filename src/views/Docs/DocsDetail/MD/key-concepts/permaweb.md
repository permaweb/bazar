## Permaweb

The permaweb is a permanent and decentralized web built on top of Arweave.

The initial goal of the traditional web was to create an accessible repository of human knowledge. Although it has been largely successful, it faces a significant issue: the web lacks permanence. When documents are deleted from one server, they are lost from the collective knowledge base. Additionally, applications that once operated on the web become inaccessible when their developers or maintainers remove or alter them. Arweave solves this problem.

The permaweb can host fully decentralized web applications. These applications operate independently within the permaweb, governed solely by their own code, without oversight from any individual or authority. Once launched, a permaweb application cannot be modified by anyone and is accessible to everyone without permissions. These applications continue to function without any maintenance or upkeep costs to the original developer.

The permaweb offers a comprehensive stack for building these applications:

- **[Arweave](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/main)**: The core system for data replication, ensuring availability through a decentralized and sustainable [endowment](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/storage-endowment).
- **[Gateways](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/gateways)**: Content delivery servers driven by various business models and incentives (e.g., arweave.net, ar-io.net, g8way.io, arweave.net, and Meson.Network).
- **[GraphQL](https://cookbook.arweave.net/guides/querying-arweave/queryingArweave.html)**: A querying system provided by gateways, enabling all data in the network to be queried in a manner similar to traditional databases and web applications. With GraphQL, you can find posts by users, filter by arbitrary tags and timestamps, etc.
- **[AO](https://ao.arweave.net/)**: Hyper-parallel computer that offers a unified environment for decentralized applications and processes.

#### The composable web

Data on the traditional web is isolated to specific applications, known as data silos. Permaweb applications share access to Arweave’s robust data lake, allowing for composable applications. Users also have a say in how their data is accessed and used for applications with the programmable Universal Data License (UDL), which can be attached to content uploaded to Arweave. This also provides clear guidance for developers on how to use data equitably in their applications.

BazAR is one of many permaweb applications. Anyone can upload tradeable atomic assets onto Arweave, which can be traded on BazAR. We are always looking to support permaweb applications wanting to integrate tradeable atomic assets. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to our team on [X](https://x.com/OurBazAR) or in the BazAR channel of the Weaver's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qhztcN3PsA).
