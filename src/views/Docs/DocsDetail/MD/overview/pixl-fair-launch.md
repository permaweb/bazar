## PIXL Token Breakdown

### Overview

PIXL is a fixed-supply token used within the Universal Content Marketplace and Bazar platform. For the Permaweb Index (PI) Fair Launch, a portion of the total supply had already been minted, while the remaining supply is divided into two allocations:

- 75% is reallocated for the PI Fair Launch.
- 25% is reserved for PIXL rewards distributed through daily engagement incentives.

#### Effective Reward Pool

The effective reward pool consists of both already minted tokens and the reserved rewards allocation. This defines the total supply available for further minting through user rewards.

#### Minting Schedule

PIXL is minted daily using a halving mechanism. The minting process is structured into cycles, with each cycle approximating one year. The number of tokens minted per day is determined by:

- A predefined number of blocks per day.
- A halving divisor that doubles with each cycle, gradually reducing the amount of new PIXL minted over time.

#### Daily Reward Calculation

The daily reward amount is derived from the effective reward pool using the halving schedule. The adjusted supply is evenly distributed over 365 days, ensuring a predictable token release over time.

#### Dynamic Distribution

Daily rewards are distributed among active users based on engagement streaks:

- Users who maintain longer consecutive activity streaks receive a multiplier, increasing their share of the daily reward pool.
- This incentivizes consistent participation within the ecosystem.

### PI Fair Launch Allocation

At **block 1,628,189,** the total circulating supply of PIXL was **15,531,330.5888**. This snapshot was used to determine the amount of PIXL reallocated for the fair launch.
Allocation Breakdown

- **CURRENT_MINTED** = 15,531,330.5888 PIXL
- **REMAINING_SUPPLY** = TOTAL_SUPPLY - CURRENT_MINTED
- **FAIR_LAUNCH_SUPPLY** = REMAINING_SUPPLY \* 0.75

Using this calculation, the fair launch allocation is **8,061,502.0584 PIXL**.

The remaining 2,687,167.3528 PIXL will be minted gradually through existing daily purchase rewards, ensuring continued ecosystem growth and engagement.

## How to Delegate AO to Earn Ecosystem Project Tokens
