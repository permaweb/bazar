## Welcome to Bazar

Bazar is a decentralized atomic asset exchange built on the permaweb. Bazar empowers creators and collectors to interact, trade, and transact with digital content of all kinds - images, music, videos, papers, components, and even applications. These guides will help you explore how to use Bazar and why this platform is more than just an NFT marketplace.

#### Built on the UCM Protocol

Bazar is a user interface built on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol, a protocol designed to enable trustless exchange of atomic assets on the permaweb. UCM allows creators and users to trade and transact with any form of digital content. A key feature of UCM is its incentivizing token, PIXL. When you buy atomic assets via UCM, you become eligible to receive PIXL tokens. UCM tracks buying streaks, which occur when users purchase one or more atomic assets on consecutive days.

###### Bazar does not take any fees

Instead, UCM captures a 0.5% fee for using the contract. If the trade involves the $wAR token, the contract purchases PIXL with the fee. It buys available orders, and if no “Sell” orders exist, it initiates a “Buy” order via a reverse Dutch auction. PIXL tokens received from these purchases are burned. The higher the trading volumes and marketplace fees, the more tokens are bought and burned. Read more about PIXL Tokenomics here. [View the UCM source code here](https://github.com/permaweb/ao-ucm).

#### Core Functionality

- **Powered by AO**: The UCM now runs on AO, a hyper-parallel computing system built on the Arweave network. AO offers a unified environment for executing decentralized applications and processes. All transactions on Bazar are carried out through AO smart contracts called processes.
- **Trustless Transactions**: Bazar provides a user interface for the UCM, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries in transactions. Over time, more UIs are expected to emerge, offering unique experiences for creators and collectors.
- **Licensable Data**: The [Universal Data License](https://udlicense.arweave.net/) (UDL) ensures that value flows equitably to creators and contributors on the permaweb. This standard framework allows creators to set their own terms for the usage of content they upload. Learn more about UDL [here](https://ao-bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/creators/universal-data-license).
- **Earn $PIXL Rewards**: The UCM protocol rewards users with PIXL tokens for maintaining a buying streak. The longer the streak, the larger the daily PIXL rewards! Learn more about earning PIXL [here](https://ao-bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/collectors/earn-pixl).

#### UCM/Bazar “Early” Release

UCM and Bazar are currently in an **“early” release**, meaning they are considered functionally complete, though minor adjustments may still be necessary.

Although AO is live on mainnet, Bazar is still running on AO testnet infrastructure until further notice. The Bazar team will provide updates on UCM/Bazar developments and the fair launch token to fund ongoing development.
