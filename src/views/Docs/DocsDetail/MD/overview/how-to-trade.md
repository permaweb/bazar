## How to trade

Bazar uses an orderbook to match buyers and sellers directly, no liquidity pools or intermediaries required.

### **Order Types**

There are two ways to trade:

**Market orders** execute immediately at the best available price. Use these when you want to trade now.

- Buy: purchases from existing listings
- Sell: fills existing bids

**Limit orders** let you set your price and wait for a match. Use these when you want to trade at a specific price.

- Bid: place a buy offer at your price
- List: create a sell listing at your price

### **Placing a Trade**

1. Connect your Wander wallet
2. Select the token pair you want to trade
3. Choose Buy, Sell, Bid, or List
4. Enter your quantity and price (limit orders only)
5. Confirm the transaction

Orders can be cancelled at any time before they are filled. Assets are held by the orderbook until the order is matched or cancelled.

### **Fees**

Bazar charges no platform fees. A 0.05% fee goes to the UCM protocol.

### **Tips**

Check the orderbook before placing a large market order. Wide spreads between bids and asks mean less active liquidity. Limit orders give you price control but may take time to fill.
