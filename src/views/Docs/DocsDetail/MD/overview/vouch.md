## Vouch your Arweave wallet

Bazar now uses [Vouch](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/) to enhance platform security and prevent sybil attacks on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) orderbook. This integration ensures better platform performance by curbing bot activity, enabling genuine users to maintain PIXL streaks and earn rewards.

### Key Details

- **Vouch Points required**: 2 points
- **When Vouch is needed**: To earn PIXL from a buying streak
- **Non-Vouched wallets**: Can still upload and trade on the UCM

###### Changes with this update

To earn $PIXL tokens, users need a vouched wallet. PIXL is a rewards token earned by maintaining a daily buying streak on the UCM. Tokens are credited directly to your profile. PIXL tokens are rewards tokens that do not necessarily have financial value. Learn more about PIXL [here](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/collectors/earn-pixl).

###### Unchanged features

Non-vouched wallets retain full access to upload with [Helix](https://helix.arweave.net/) and trade atomic assets on Bazar.

### What is Vouch?

Vouch is an open-source reputation system on AO that calculates a “humanity score” using a combination of methods and integrations including:

- **AO ecosystem data**
- **Ethereum blockchain activity**
- **Web2 social presence**

###### Key benefits:

- Verifies genuine users for enhanced security.
- Enables prioritized rewards based on reputation.
- Encourages positive ecosystem behavior.

###### **Adoption**:

Vouch is currently used by Bazar, Llama Land, and Permaverse. Other permaweb apps can integrate it through the [Vouch Developer Docs](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/developers).

### How to earn Vouch Points

###### **1. Vouch X**

- Link your Twitter/X account.
- Points are awarded based on account criteria such as age and usage.
- Each account can only be linked once.

###### **2. Vouch Gitcoin Passport**

- Utilize Gitcoin [Passport](https://app.passport.xyz/) to aggregate blockchain activities, social profiles, and KYC data.

###### **3. Vouch AO Balance**

- Accumulate AO tokens by holding AR or bridging stETH and DAI in the [AO pre-bridge](https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint).
- This method can be used until AO becomes tradable (~Feb 2025).

###### **4. Stake wAR**

- Earn additional points by staking wAR in the [Vouch Portal](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/).
- Points vary by staking duration and AR price. Tokens are securely stored and can be withdrawn after the lock period. See the staking contract [here](https://www.ao.link/#/entity/zYBcGWB4KJeB4pc04XiNOKrD0DQBPelvNBbfDnqiunQ)

### FAQs

###### **Do I Need Vouch for All Transactions?**

No, Vouch is only required to build PIXL streaks. Non-vouched wallets can still upload, buy, and sell on the UCM.

###### **What Happens if I Lose My Streak?**

Losing your streak resets the daily PIXL rewards to 0. You can see the streak timer by clicking the flame icon in the top right of the Bazar header.

###### **How do I know if I am Vouched?**

The Vouch Portal shows how many Vouch Points your wallet has. 2 points are required for Bazar PIXL rewards. Once vouched, you will see a green checkmark next to your name in the Bazar sidebar.
