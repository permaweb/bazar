## How to fund your account

Bazar supports trading of AO-based tokens. To get started you will need AO or AR in your wallet.

### **Get AO**

Purchase AO directly on a centralized exchange:

- [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en/trade/spot/AO/USDT)
- [Gate](https://www.gate.com/trade/AO_USDT)
- [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/AO_USDT)

Or [mint AO](https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint/deposits/) by bridging qualified assets (stETH, USDS, DAI) or by holding AR.

Already on the permaweb? Swap PI, wAR or other AO-based tokens for AO directly on [Bazar](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/asset/0syT13r0s0tgPmIed95bJnuSqaD29HQNN8D3ElLSrsc).

### **Get AR**

Purchase AR on a centralized exchange:

- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/arweave)
- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/price/arweave)
- [OKX](https://www.okx.com)
- [Uphold](https://uphold.com/assets/crypto/buy-arweave)

Or buy AR directly in your [Wander](https://www.wander.app/) wallet using Transak: open Wander, click "Buy AR," and follow the steps. KYC may be required depending on your location.

#### **Bridge AR to AO**

If you hold AR and want to trade on AO, bridge it using [AOX](https://aox.arweave.net). Your bridged funds will appear as wAR in your wallet and will be available to trade on Bazar.

Not all exchanges are available in every country. This is not financial advice.
